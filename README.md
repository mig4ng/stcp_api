# STCP API - Elixir

A simple Elixir API for retrieving real-time STCP bus arrival times.

## About

This is an Elixir port of [ruitcatarino/stcp-api](https://github.com/ruitcatarino/stcp-api), converted using Claude AI with some manual intervention. 

**Note**: This is not available on Hex. The code is intentionally simple - just copy and paste it into your app instead of adding another dependency.

## Background

The original Python API by [ruitcatarino](https://github.com/ruitcatarino) included OpenAPI documentation. When converted to Elixir, I initially added OpenAPI support to test it out, but then removed it because the API is very simple and doesn't need the extra dependency. I maintained a copy of the original OpenAPI lib file and mix file, if you prefer it.

I also simplified the generated code and removed character sanitization (removal of Portuguese accents like `รก` and `รฃ`) because I wanted proper Portuguese in my app.

This client was created for use in [mig4ng/stcp](https://github.com/mig4ng/stcp) and is published here so you don't need to spend tokens converting or creating from scratch.

## Installation

Copy and paste it into your app instead of adding another dependency.
